Your colleague, the engagement partner, asks you to do Visualizing Customer’s and Agent’s Behaviors

Possible KPIs include (to get you started, but not limited to):

- Overall customer satisfaction
- Overall calls answered/abandoned
- Calls by time
- Average speed of answer
- Agent’s performance quadrant -> average handle time (talk duration) vs calls answered

### customer retaintion analysis Details 

A few weeks after presenting your dashboard to the management, the Retention Manager from the telecom reaches out to you directly. He was impressed by your work and asked if you can put together a dashboard about customer retention.

In addition, to better understand the data, the telecom Retention Manager has scheduled a meeting with the engagement partner at PwC to cover these points:

- Customers in the telecom industry are hard-earned: we don’t want to lose them
- The retention department is here to get customers back in case of termination
- Currently, we get in touch after they have terminated the contract, but this is reactionary: it would be better to know in advance who is at risk
- We  have done customer analysis with Excel: it has always ended in a dead-end
- We would like to know more about our customers: visualised clearly so that it’s self-explanatory for our management

The Retentions Manager has provided some information

- Customers who left within the last month
- Services each customer has signed up for: phone, multiple lines, internet, online security, online backup, device protection, tech support, and streaming TV and movies
- Customer account information: how long as a customer, contract, payment method, paperless billing, monthly charges, total charges and number of tickets opened in the categories administrative and technical
- Demographic info about customers – gender, age range, and if they have partners and dependents

Your colleague, the engagement partner, asks you to do the following tasks:

- Define proper KPIs
- Create a dashboard for the retention manager reflecting the KPIs
- Write a short email to him (the engagement partner) explaining your findings, and include suggestions as to what needs to be changed

# analysis and Insights

## Call centre Insight Summary

The call center is performing well, with 81% customer satisfaction and a strong call answer rate. However, the abandoned call rate (18.92%) suggests room for improvement in reducing customer wait times, especially during peak hours. Performance variation among agents, with Dan excelling and Diane needing improvement, indicates that targeted training could enhance overall service quality.

## customer retaintion Insights Summary

Most customers prefer phone and internet services, with a strong preference for fiber optic internet. Retention beyond 1 year drops off significantly, suggesting an opportunity for improving long-term customer retention strategies. Electronic payments and paperless billing are widely preferred, showing a shift toward digital convenience. Additionally, the distribution of technical and administrative tickets could indicate areas of service improvement or customer needs.
